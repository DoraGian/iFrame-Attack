<h1>Timing Attacks on Inline Frames</h1>
<p>The same origin policy is one of the Web’s fundamental security features.
  Among other implications, this prevents scripts running in a parent frame
  to access DOM elements within an iframe loaded from a different origin.
  Recently, side channel attacks utilizing rendering timings [1] or download
  sizes [2] have been published.</p>

<p>Browser vendors reacted to the CSS filter based rendering timing attack [1]
   by rewriting the filter code to be executed in constant time. However,
   the fundamental problem could not be addressed. Since both attacker and target
   frame share the same resources for rendering (i.e. hardware) complex victim
   webpages will have a higher impact on the frames per seconds drawable in the
   attacker frame. This yields one bit of information (complex/simple webpage)
   which is enough to determine the login status of a user on a specific webpage.
   Furthermore, modifying the fragment identifier (#) of a loaded iframe can
   force redraw events – if that fragment identifier is present in the currently
   loaded iframe. Again, this yields one bit of information.</p>
